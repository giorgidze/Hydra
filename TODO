Short Term
-----------

Replace pre with cur.


Inline the code for vector getters and setters.


Medium Term
-----------

Implement support for higher index systems using symbolic methods instead of
currently used numerical methods.


Impulses can be introduced in addition to events to avoid a complete code
regeneration in some cases.


Sometimes KINSOL fails when provided initial guess is 0. As a temporary
solution initial guess of 0.1 is used.


Provide proper documentation.


Provide testing framework and check the code coverage.


Long Term
-----------


Sundials has support for inequalities. Maybe this can be
put into a good use.


Statically check that pres do not appear in ordinary and init equations.


Unicode characters are not supported in the anti-quoted Haskell
expressions. Currently the corresponding line in the grammar file reads:

token HsExpr ('$' (char - '$')* '$') ;

according to BNFC documentation "char" represents an ASCII character.
